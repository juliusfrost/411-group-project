Happy path:

* User fills in the optional fields for cuisine, food type, and price.
* A preferences will be combined and turned into JSON format for storage
* User's profile will be updated to match these preferences

What could go wrong:

* User profile does not exist yet in the database
    * Check the database to make sure it doesnt exist.
    * Create the new profile and set it with the new information
