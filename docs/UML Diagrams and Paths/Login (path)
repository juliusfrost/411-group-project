Happy Path:

* User chooses to log in with Google
* The login handler will sent a request to Google for login
* Google will return a login token
* The user will be redirected to Google's login page
* The user sends a login request to Google with their credentials
* Google authenticates the user
* The login handler will then find the user in the database and fetch the session id they belong to
* The user will be redirected to their session's page

Failed authentication:

* Google fails to authenticate the user
* The user will be redirected to the home screen of the app

User does not belong to a session:

* The login handler fails to find the user in the database, or the user does not have an active session
* The login handler redirects the user to the selection page where they can choose to host or join a session
