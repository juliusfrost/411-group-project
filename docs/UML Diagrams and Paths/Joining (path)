Happy Path:

* User chooses to join a session
* A join form will be generated by a form handler
* The user must submit the form with a session id of the session they are joining
* The session id will be passed to a session handler.
* The session handler will confirm that the session id is valid by checking the database and return true
* The form handler will then generate a personal information form for the user to fill
* Once the user enters valid information in the form, they can submit the form
* This will call a function that will parse the request and pull out the relevant information
* This information and the session id will be passed again to the session handler
* The session handler will fetch the session information from the database and place it in a session object
* The session object will be updated by adding the user id as a guest
* The session collection of the database will be updated.
* The user collection of the database will be updated by either adding the new user or updating if the user was already in the database.
* The user will have their personal information as well as the session id they belong to stored in the database
* Then the session object will return and the user will be redirected to the session page.


Invalid session id:

* The session handler fails to validate the given session id (it does not exist in the database)
* The session handler will return false
* The user will be alerted that the session id they entered is invalid and that they should try again
