Happy path:

* A pop up form will be shown to the user
* The form will have 1-hour time blocks from 8 am to 10 pm that the user can select
* For each selected time block, every day of the session's week will be marked as
  unavailable for the user (at that time)
* This blocked availability will be combined with the user's Google Calendar restrictions
* Combined restrictions turned into JSON and stored into user profile
* Selecting these time blocks is entirely optional

What could go wrong:

* User profile does not exist yet in the database
    * Check the database to make sure it doesnt exist.
    * Create the new profile and set it with the new information
