Happy Path:

* User chooses to log in with Google
* The login handler will sent a request to Google for login
* Google will return a login token
* The user will be redirected to Google's login page
* The user sends a login request to Google with their credentials
* Google authenticates the user
* Google will redirect them to our home page
* Check if the user has an active session in the database
* The user will be redirected to their session's page

What could go wrong:

* Failed authentication:
    * Google fails to authenticate the user
    * Google will inform them that their credentials are invalid and allow them to try again

* User does not belong to a session:
    * The user has no active session marked in the database
    * The user is redirected to the home page where they can create or join a session
