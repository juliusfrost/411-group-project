Happy Path:

* User chooses to join a session
* A session ID form will pop up on the screen
* The user must submit the form with a session id of the session they are joining
* The session id will be passed to a session handler.
* The session handler will confirm that the session id is valid by checking the database
* The form handler will then generate a personal information form for the user to fill
* Once the user enters information in the form, they can submit the form
* This will call a function that will parse the request and pull out the relevant information
* A call will be made to the Google calendar API to get calendar events.
* Events will be parsed to build availability.
* The user profile relation of the database will be updated by either adding the new user or updating if the user was already in the database.
* The user will have their personal information as well as the session id they belong to stored in the database
* Then user will then be redirected to the session page.


What could go wrong:

* Invalid session id:
    * The session handler fails to validate the given session id (it does not exist in the database)
    * The user will be alerted that the session id they entered is invalid and that they should try again

* User OAuth token is expired and cannot make call to calendar API
    * Check if token is expired, and refresh it using the user's refresh token
