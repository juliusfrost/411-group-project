Happy Path:

* User chooses to host a session
* Two forms (one for time frame and one for personal information) will be generated by a form handler
* The two forms will be returned and the user will be instructed to fill them
* Once the user enters valid information in the forms, they can submit the forms
* This will call a function that will parse the request and pull out the relevant information
* This information will be passed on to a function in the session handler that will generate a new session object
* The new session object will be given a newly generated id and will store the time frame as well as the user id as host
* The session collection of the database will be updated with this new session.
* The user collection of the database will be updated by either adding the new user or updating if the user was already in the database.
* The user will have their personal information as well as the session id they belong to stored in the database
* Then the session object will return and the user will be redirected to the session page.
