Before closing the session, the host has the ability to tick the checkbox of members to signal that they must attend.
Once everyone the host wants has joined the session. The host can click to close the session. Once the session is closed the web app will determine a common time for everyone in the session and a list of five restaurants that are available at that time, around an area close to the location preferences of members, and satisfies as many restaurant restrictions as possible. 
If a location cannot be determined for any member of the session, the web app will prompt the host to provide a location in a pop-up window in order to proceed. Otherwise, if at least one location preference exists, the app will use those preferences. 
If no common time can be found, the web app will begin to eliminate members that do not have the must attend checkbox ticked and keep trying. If only members that must attend remain and no time can be found still, then the web app will simply say that no time is found, and to please make a new session with a different week/members
If a time and place is able to be determined, and the list of 5 restaurants is provided, members of the session will be able to vote on the restaurants (refer to restaurant voting story)
