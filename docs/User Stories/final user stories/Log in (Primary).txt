When I enter the web app I will see a window that prompts me to log in to my Google account. If I do not have a Google account I can click a button to make an account, which will take me to Google’s page where I can do so. Otherwise, I can fill in my username and password in the fields provided. If I enter both of my credentials correctly, I can proceed into the web app. If I get either of my credentials wrong I will see a note that I got one of them wrong and that I should try again.  
Once I enter the web app with my Google account, I will be redirected to my active session’s page (if I have one). Otherwise I will see a window with two options: host a session or join a session (Refer to the hosting/joining sessions stories).
